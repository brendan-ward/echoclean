# Example Rule files

## Northwest California

This ruleset is devised for a site in northwest California to get you started
and to demonstrate the format of rulesets. You will need to adjust it based on
the species that occur at your site, their relative activity levels, and your
comfort level with Sonobatâ€™s ability to auto-ID the species at your site based
on your own manual vetting. Be aware that even 2 sites that very near each
other may differ on relative activity levels of species that may suggest
tweaking of the rules. Even for the site that these rules are optimized for
there may be more logical and elegant ways to express the rules: you should try
to do so.
